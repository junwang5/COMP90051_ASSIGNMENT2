Summaryï¼š
We implemented a DANN model to address domain adaptation challenges in classification tasks. The model was compared against Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Experimental results demonstrated that DANN achieved the best overall performance among all tested models.

How to run the DANN model:
1. Open the notebook called DANN_final_version.ipynb under the Code file to run the model

2. Run all cells sequentially.

3. Ensure required packages (e.g., torch, sklearn, matplotlib) are installed.


How to generate all the report graph:

1. Open the report_graph.ipynb under the Graphs folder.
   
3. Run all the cells to generate all the report graph.
